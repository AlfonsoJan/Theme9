Introduction to Machine Learning

## About the project
For this course we are introduced to Data Mining and Machine learning. I will characterize a simple model of classification. That will predict protein localization sites in cellular sites.

research question: Can machine learning predict protein localization based on their aminoacid sequences.

The data has been retrived from [uci.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Yeast)
